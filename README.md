A Minecraft Launcher written in Python using Tkinter.

Based on [PyCraft by shasankp000](https://github.com/shasankp000/PyCraft).

## Wiki
Check out the [eClient Wiki](https://github.com/v-pun215/eClient/wiki), which has all the updated information on how to run Minecraft like you want to!

## New Website!
Check it out at [https://eclient.vpun215.tech](https://eclient.vpun215.tech).

You can see the [archived source code](https://github.com/v-pun215/eClient-website) of the old one as well.

This change comes after I acquired the domain [vpun215.tech](https://vpun215.tech).

## Project Overview
This launcher aims to be the best launcher (in Python) built for Windows.

It has many features including a Mod Installer.

This launcher downloads Minecraft Libraries from the official libraries.minecraft.net.

## Bugs
A check means that the bug has been resolved.

- [x] When launching Minecraft 1.20, Minecraft loads in with 'Failed to Quick Play'. 
- [ ] Not able to login to Mojang accounts anymore (Mojang disabled the API).
- [ ] Forge can't install and run properly (Only in versions before 1.13).

**Report new bugs in [Issues](https://github.com/v-pun215/eClient/issues).**
## Features
- Can install and launch all versions of Minecraft: Java Edition (starting from 1.0).
- Can install mods (from Modrinth) directly from the launcher.
- Supports Fabric, Forge and [Optifine](https://optifine.net).
- Ability to login with Ely.by, Offline Accounts and **Microsoft Accounts** (see [v1.5](https://github.com/v-pun215/eClient/releases/v1.5)).
- Can run the game (in singleplayer) when offline, using an *offline* account.

## Skins
eClient supports custom Minecraft skins.

For Microsoft Accounts:
 - Change your skin [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/msaprofile/mygames/editskin).
 - Wait a few minutes, then relaunch eClient.

For Ely.by Accounts:
 - Change your skin [here](https://ely.by/skins).
 - Wait a few minutes, then relaunch eClient.

Offline Accounts don't have support for custom skins, as they are not authenticated.

## About the installer.
The Installer might get flagged as a virus on your machine.

This is a *false positive*.

This happens because I compile the installer using PyInstaller.

Microsoft Defender should not report it as a virus.

**IMPORTANT**: This might appear after double-clicking on the installer.

To solve this issue, click ```More Info``` and then click ```Run Anyway```.

This is because I haven't signed this exe (and I don't plan to, unless someone gives me a couple hundred bucks).
